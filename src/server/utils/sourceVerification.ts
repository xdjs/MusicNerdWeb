/**
 * Whether a vault source is something we actually READ, or something a model
 * merely TOLD us about.
 *
 * Why this module exists (product-owner-caught, twice):
 *
 *   1. An About cited the artist's SoundBetter profile for a claim about his
 *      influences. The stored `snippet` said exactly that — but `extracted_text`
 *      was empty, meaning the page was never fetched. The snippet was Gemini's
 *      own description of a search result, stored as if it were evidence and
 *      later cited as if it were verified. The live URL didn't even contain the
 *      claim.
 *   2. Several cited URLs simply did not exist: `belltower.pictures/...` (no
 *      such domain, while `belltowerpictures.com/...` is real),
 *      `rvamag.com/music/local-guitar-hero-an-interview-with-rein/` (404, while
 *      a differently-slugged article on the same site is real), five Apple Music
 *      artist IDs of which one resolved.
 *
 * Both trace to one mistake: we asked a language model to TYPE URLs and then
 * treated what it typed as retrieved data. A model asked for a URL will produce
 * a plausible one. The near-miss clusters in the database — three slug variants
 * of one article, two spellings of one domain — are the signature of guessing,
 * and in every cluster the variant that fetched successfully was the real one.
 *
 * So: fetching is the arbiter. A claim may only cite a page we retrieved and
 * read. Anything else is a lead — worth showing, worth clicking, never evidence.

/** How a candidate source came back when we actually went and asked for it.

 *    JS-only render). Shown and clickable; never cited. The artist can confirm
 *    it themselves, which is the whole point of showing it.
 *  - `dead` — the URL does not resolve or does not exist. Dropped entirely.

 *  "RANGO" as a wordmark and puts "Pete" only in an image, so demanding both
 *  "pete" and "rango" rejected his actual website. The distinctive token alone
 *  still rejects everything this check exists to catch — a parked GoDaddy page,
 *  a "NO RESULTS FOUND" template, and an anonymized profile contain no part of
 *  the name — while keeping real pages that style the name unusually.
 *
 *  Namesake risk is real but is not this function's job: discovery already
