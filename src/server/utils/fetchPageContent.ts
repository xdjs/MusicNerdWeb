 *    selection had never once run against a real scrape; its unit tests passed
 *    because they fed it text with newlines still in it.
 * 2. Nothing was removed but <script> and <style>. So a stored "source" could
 *    be a cookie-consent policy listing Google Analytics cookie durations
 *    (lifechangesnetwork, everything past character 4,700), or a comment form
 *    and a list of unrelated articles (voyagemia).
 *
 * Drop the chrome, keep the block structure, decode the entities. What survives
 * is roughly what a reader would have read.
 *
 * Regex rather than a DOM parse on purpose: this runs on a request-latency path
 * during onboarding, against pages we do not control, and a partial result is
 * fine — whatever survives is judged again by judgeSourceRelevance and
 * selectSourceText. It CANNOT remove a rival's listing from a marketplace page
 * (soundbetter renders other producers' credits in the same generic <div>s as
