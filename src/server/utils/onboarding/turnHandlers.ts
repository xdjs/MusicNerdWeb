 *   - a namesake can't be cited (requireFullName gates citability)
 *
 * Sources are auto-APPROVED, which is safe for a reason worth stating: approval
 * has never been what makes a source citable. `isCitableSource` reads
 * extractedText, which is only ever populated by machine verification. So an
 * un-curated namesake sits in the vault as a lead the artist can remove, and
 * never reaches their About.
 *
 * Failure is partial, not fatal: each stage confirms its own step, so a crash
 * mid-build leaves the artist resuming at exactly the stage that failed, using

    // produce two candidates for one platform: tier 3 keeps the first confirmed
    // hit per platform, and `missing.delete` stops every later tier revisiting a
    // platform an earlier one resolved. The two accounts come from DIFFERENT
    // SYSTEMS — discovery guessed `blackdavemk2` from the artist's name, the
    // vault search found `blackdave.xyz` and corroborated it — and they only
    // ever meet in the artist's row.
    //
    // So the moment to ask is here: a column discovery filled with a guess, that
    // the search has since replaced with something better evidenced. Both are
    // real accounts, both were Black Dave MK2's, and picking one without asking
    // is what this whole change exists to stop.
