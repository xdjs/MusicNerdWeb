/**
 * Post-claim onboarding — discovers an artist's MISSING platform profiles
 * from whatever identity anchors they already have (a bare Deezer/Spotify
 * ID, existing social links) and proposes them for the artist to confirm.
 *
 * NEVER throws — any failure (DB down, provider down, Gemini down, bad JSON,
 * network) degrades to an empty result so a discovery failure can never
 * break the onboarding `profiles` turn (the step behaves exactly as it does
 * without discovery).
 *
 * FINDING candidates is a four-tier cascade, run in authority + speed order,
 * each tier skipping platforms an earlier tier already proposed:
 *
 *   Tier 1 — our own `artist_id_mappings` table (free, instant, DB read).
 *   Tier 2 — platform search APIs (Spotify/Deezer `searchArtists`, deterministic,
 *            sub-second) for whichever of spotify/deezer is missing.
 *   Tier 3 — deterministic HANDLE PROBING: build a small set of candidate
 *            handles (existing handle-shaped links, handles confirmed
 *            earlier in this run, and a few slugs derived from the artist's
 *            name), fetch each candidate URL directly via `fetchLinkPreview`,
 *            and require POSITIVE evidence of the artist's NAME — never the
 *            handle itself, which is nearly always echoed inside a page's
 *            og:title (e.g. a stranger's Instagram bio titled "Peter
 *            Lyrøholm (@peterango)" contains the probed handle "peterango"
 *            and would satisfy a naive "title contains handle" check). See
 *            `stripHandleAndBoilerplate`/`runHandleProbe` for the exact
 *            rule: strip the handle and platform boilerplate out of the
 *            title first, cross-check whatever real name text remains, and
 *            treat "nothing meaningful remains" as a MISS, not a hit. An
 *            og:image with no usable title is trusted only for an already
 *            CONFIRMED handle (an existing link, or one confirmed on another
 *            platform this run) — never for a bare name-derived guess.
 *            Sub-second per probe and replaces what used to be a
 *            per-platform Gemini search (measured live: that shape timed out
 *            on 4 of 7 platforms and found ZERO candidates for an artist who
 *            genuinely has profiles on all of them — see the
 *            discovery-rebuild report).
 *   Tier 4 — a REAL web search (Tavily, via `webSearch.ts`), kept ONLY as a
 *            last resort for whatever tier 3's probing couldn't confirm and
 *            only if the time budget allows: one search per remaining
 *            platform, each restricted to that platform's own domain via
 *            `include_domains` — never one big open-web call asking about
 *            every platform at once. This replaces what used to be a
 *            per-platform GEMINI search: a grounded LLM deciding whether/
 *            what to search is not a search API — measured live, that shape
 *            timed out on most platforms and, when it did answer, confidently
 *            returned an unrelated stranger's profile (see the web-search
 *            report). Every search hit is a LEAD, not proof: each result
 *            first has to look like an actual profile URL (`looksLikeProfileUrl`
 *            — a search engine returns arbitrary pages, not just profiles,
 *            and `extractArtistId`'s regexes were never designed to tell the
 *            difference), then the resolved HANDLE has to carry every word of the artist's
 *            name (`handleCoversArtistName` — the primary discriminator; a
 *            title/snippet-only check is too weak for a same-surname
 *            stranger or a common-word artist name — see
 *            `resultPassesNameCheck` for the live-tested detail), before the
 *            surviving candidate runs the full `validateCandidate` gate
 *            pipeline below like every other tier.
 *
 * A search result (tier 4) is a lead a stranger's page can satisfy just as
 * easily as the real artist's, so every candidate it proposes is validated
 * before it's ever shown to an artist; see the numbered gates in
 * `validateCandidate` below. Tiers 1/2/3 are deterministic (DB read, search
 * API, or a direct HTTP probe) and never hallucinate/misattribute a URL, so
 * the OG-existence gate only re-applies to tier 4 — tier 3's own probe fetch
 * already IS that check, so it isn't repeated. Nothing here writes to the
 * database; discovery only PROPOSES, the existing `confirm_profiles` →
 * `extractArtistId` → `setArtistLink` path (unchanged) is what actually
 * saves an accepted link.
 *
 * Tier 4 also FEEDS BACK into tier 3's probing: any handle it confirms is
 * propagated through the exact same probe mechanism tier 3 uses internally
 * (see `propagateConfirmedHandles`) — so one successful search (say,
 * Instagram) can resolve X/TikTok/Facebook for free from the confirmed
 * handle, without a second search call per platform.
 *
 * Results STREAM: `discoverArtistProfilesStream` is an async generator that
 * yields a `searching`/`checked` pair as each platform lookup starts/settles
 * and a `found` event the instant a candidate clears validation — never a
 * silent `Promise.all` that dumps everything at once. `discoverArtistProfiles`
 * is a thin array-returning wrapper over it for callers that just want the
 * final list.

// in-handler deadline (60s maxDuration) — discovery is one piece of a turn
// that also runs buildProfilesPayload (urlmap lookups + its own ~5s preview
// budget) and the SSE plumbing around it.
//
// Unlike the retired single-combined-call design (one 24s-capped Gemini call
// grounded across up to 6 platforms — measured at 44.3s end-to-end for one
// real, obscure artist, returning ZERO candidates because the call blew its
// own timeout), the cascade below is fast BY CONSTRUCTION: tier 1 is a DB
// read, tier 2 is one or two deterministic HTTP calls, tier 3 is a handful of
// sub-second HTTP probes run with a bounded concurrency, and tier 4 (a real
// web search, last resort only) is N single-platform search calls run in
// PARALLEL, each bounded by `webSearch.ts`'s own ~6s per-request timeout — the
// slowest of those (not their sum) bounds the tier, plus one more bounded
// probe round if tier 4 confirms a handle to propagate. Worst case is roughly
// tier1(<1s) + tier2(~1-2s) + tier3(a couple probe rounds, each
// ≤PROBE_CONCURRENCY-wide and individually sub-second) + tier4(~6s, only for
// whatever's still missing) + a propagate round (sub-second, probe-shaped) +
// a per-candidate preview fetch (≤4s, 8s worst case chained for Spotify — see
// linkPreview.ts) ≈ well under 15s. DISCOVERY_BUDGET_MS remains a hard
// backstop, checked between tiers inside the generator itself, so a
// pathological run (e.g. a hung DB connection) still can't blow the turn
// budget — it stops yielding instead.
//
// Raised 20s → 35s: real runs were hitting the backstop often enough that the
// same artist saw a different number of profiles from one run to the next,
// because tier 4 (the web-search last resort, the tier most likely to find the
// platforms tiers 1-3 missed) is also the tier most likely to be cut. Stopping
// early is silent by design — it just stops yielding — so a truncated search is
// indistinguishable from a thorough one that found less. 35s still leaves ~20s
