 * Adopt the account handles an artist published on their own page.

 * them and `extractArticleLinks` is same-host so it never sees them. Sherwinn
 * Brice's Instagram is `dupesdidit`, published on dupes.rocks, while profile
 * discovery guessed `dupes` from his name. No name-derived slug reaches it.
 *
 * But we cannot trust every account link on every page — a magazine's footer
 * links to the MAGAZINE's Instagram, and adopting that would put a publication's
 * account on an artist's profile.
 *
 * CORROBORATION: his site links to dupes.bandcamp.com and we already hold
 * `bandcamp: dupes` for him, confirmed. A page linking to an identifier we have
 * independently verified is his hub. RVA Mag's footer does not link to his
 * Bandcamp. Identity through a matched (platform, id) pair, never through a
 * name — the discipline that keeps a film soundtrack's Wikipedia page off an
 * artist's profile.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY INDEPENDENT OF THE RELEVANCE JUDGE below. The judge decides
 * whether a page is worth citing as coverage; this decides whose page it is,
 * from a verified id rather than from text. A page can legitimately fail the
 * judge (an artist's own site is not "coverage") and still be authoritative
 * about its owner's handles.
 *
 * Links are resolved ONCE. `extractArtistId` reads the whole urlmap from the
 * database with no memoisation, so corroborating and adopting in two separate
 * passes cost twice the round trips on a latency-bounded step — invisible in
 * tests, where it is mocked, and only visible in production.
