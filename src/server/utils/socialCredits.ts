/**
 * Reading captions instead of counting them.
 *
 * `socialSignals.ts` is a word-frequency counter, and the corpus it runs over
 * is prose. Pharaoh Sistare's feed contains "Mixing & Mastering Engineer:
 * @p3t3rango", "@gradylisiousness who I didn't know at the time would became my
 * first bassist for all of my shows thus far", and a caption explaining that he
 * wrote a Christmas record about spending the holidays without someone who had
 * died. We stored every word of that and represented it as the term `single`,
 * counted eleven times. Twelve of his sixty captions carry a role credit next to
 * a handle, and none of them could become a question, a collaborator, or a line
 * in his profile.
 *
 * A regular expression handles "Mixed by @x". It does not handle the bassist
 * sentence, and that sentence is the reason this is a model call.
 *
 * WHAT STOPS IT INVENTING PEOPLE. The model is given captions and asked to
 * report what is in them, and every claim it returns is then checked against
 * the post it claims to have come from:
 *
 *   1. The cited url must be one we passed in.
 *   2. The quote must actually appear in that post's caption.
 *   3. The person must appear in that post — in its stored `mentions`, or by
 *      name in the caption text.
 *
 * A claim failing any of these is dropped, not repaired. This is the same
 * entity-grounding rule discovery uses: the model may only tell us about things
 * that were already in front of it.
 *
 * OWN POSTS ONLY. A scraped feed contains posts authored by other people. A
 * caption written by someone else is not the artist's statement and is never
 * read here, which is the same rule `socialSignals.ts` follows for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * SELF-CREDITS ARE FACTS, NOT EDGES. "Recording Engineer: Pharaoh Sistare" says
 * something real about how he works and belongs on his profile. It must never
 * become a collaboration between him and himself.
 *
 * NOT SCOPED TO RECENT ACTIVITY. `selectRecentPosts` exists so that questions
 * are about what an artist is doing now. Credits are biographical: a first
 * bassist is permanently a first bassist. This reads the whole history.

Report what the captions SAY. Do not infer, summarise, or add anything that is not written there.

Return JSON: {"credits": [...], "statements": [...]}

A CREDIT is a person given a role in making something. Examples of the form:
  "Mixing & Mastering Engineer: @someone"     -> subject "someone", role "Mixing & Mastering Engineer"
  "Shot by @someone"                          -> subject "someone", role "Shot by"
  "@someone playing the chord progression"    -> subject "someone", role "playing the chord progression"
  "@someone became my first bassist"          -> subject "someone", role "first bassist"
  "feat. @someone"                            -> subject "someone", role "featured artist"
Each credit: {"subject", "isHandle", "role", "quote", "url"}
  subject  - the @handle WITHOUT the @, or the person's name if no handle was used
  isHandle - true if you took it from an @handle, false if it is a bare name
  role     - the job, in ${artistName}'s OWN WORDS. AT MOST SIX WORDS. A role is
             "Bass", "Mastered by", "Mixing & Mastering Engineer", "on guitar".
             It is NOT a sentence about a relationship. If the caption only says
             how ${artistName} feels about somebody, or what they talked about,
             or that they admire them, that is NOT a credit — leave it out.
  quote    - the sentence or line you read it from, copied EXACTLY from the caption
  url      - the url of the post the caption belongs to

${artistName} often credits THEMSELVES ("Written & Produced by: ${artistName}"). Report these too, exactly the same way. Do not skip them and do not mark them differently; they will be handled downstream.

A STATEMENT is ${artistName}, in their own words, about anything that makes them who they are. TWO kinds matter equally and you must look for both:

  THE WORK - what a song is about, why they made it, how it got made, what changed for them, what they are building towards.

  THE PERSON - where they come from, their family, their heritage, the people and places that shaped them, what they believe, what they do when they are not making music, a memory, a loss, a meal, a friendship, a turning point.

Do not treat the second kind as off-topic. A musician reminiscing about their mother teaching them to make empanadas, or naming the record a friend handed them at fourteen that changed everything, is telling you who they are. That is the most valuable thing in the feed and it is the thing most easily mistaken for noise.

Not announcements ("out now", "link in bio"), not thank-you lists, not hashtags, not instructions or recipes copied out in full. When a post wraps a personal memory around something procedural, quote the memory and leave the procedure.
Each statement: {"quote", "topic", "url"}
  quote - their words, copied EXACTLY from the caption, one to three sentences
  topic - a few words naming what it is about ("why he wrote My Dear", "his mother teaching him to make empanadas")
  url   - the url of the post

HOW TO WORK: go through the captions ONE AT A TIME, in the order given, and consider every single one before you answer. You are not picking highlights and you are not summarising the feed. Each caption is a separate question: does this one credit anybody, and does this one say something about who ${artistName} is? A caption you skipped is a piece of somebody's life we lose.

Rules:
- Copy quotes character for character from the caption you were given. Do not tidy, trim, join, or paraphrase them.
- Use only the url that was given with that caption.
- A caption with no credit and nothing worth quoting contributes nothing. Empty arrays are the correct answer for a feed of announcements.
- Never report a person who is not named in that caption.
- BEING THERE IS NOT A JOB. "I did X with @a and @b" says @a and @b were there. It does NOT give them the role X. Neither does being tagged, thanked, or named alongside a place, an event, a brand or a track. A credit needs the caption to say the person DID something on the thing being made.
    "Then I went to NY to do my very first @breath.church with @sage.breath and the boys @thegreatzandini"
      -> NO credits. That is somewhere they went together.
    "@whoisoyabun opening up for @travisscott"    -> NOT a credit. That is his gig, not work on ${artistName}'s record.
    "@bycherele KIKI is being used for @wnba"     -> NOT a credit. That is her track, somewhere else.
- A ROLE IS NEVER A USERNAME. If the words you are about to write as the role contain somebody's @handle, you have copied the sentence's subject matter instead of reading a job. Leave it out.
