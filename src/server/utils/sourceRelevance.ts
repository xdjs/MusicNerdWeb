/**
 * Is this fetched page actually about THIS artist?
 *
 * Relevance used to be decided by `nameAppearsIn` — does the page contain the
 * literal artist name. That is a substring test standing in for a judgement, and
 * it cannot distinguish:
 *   - a Chord DAVE amplifier review from Black Dave the artist
 *   - a Peter Calandra interview from Pete Rango
 *   - Dave the UK rapper's Guardian piece from Black Dave MK2
 * All three reached real artists' vaults.
 *
 * Meanwhile a VERIFIED identity anchor sat unused: the artist's platform ID,
 * their real catalog from Spotify, their confirmed handles. A model reading the
 * page against that anchor can answer the question the substring check was
 * pretending to answer. This is the division already established for retrieval —
 * a search API retrieves, the model judges — finally applied to judgement.
 *
 * BINDING BY INDEX, NOT URL. The model is given numbered candidates and returns
 * verdicts by number. It is never asked to echo a URL: a model that echoes
 * identifiers can invent them, which is exactly how this pipeline previously
 * ended up storing a YouTube video that does not exist. An index outside the
 * supplied range is discarded rather than guessed at.
 *
 * NEVER THROWS, and never silently rejects on failure. If the model is
 * unavailable, malformed, or times out, every candidate comes back `undecided`
 * and the caller falls back to the existing name check. A relevance judge that
 * deletes an artist's real press when Gemini has a bad day is worse than no
 * judge at all.

The artist is identified by the anchor block: their name, their verified releases, and accounts confirmed to be theirs. The name alone is NOT sufficient evidence — people and products share names.

Give each page exactly one verdict:

"about" — the page is COVERAGE OF THIS ARTIST. An interview, a review, a feature, a profile written about them, their own page about themselves. Someone set out to write about this person.

"lists" — the page is real and does concern this artist, but it INDEXES rather than covers. A directory, a tag or category archive, a search-results page, a marketplace listing, a chart, a roster, a credits index, a "related artists" page. The tell is that the page's purpose is enumeration: most of it is about OTHER people, or it is navigation and filters, and the artist is one entry among many. Titles like "Producers who worked with X", "X Archives", "Artists similar to X" are this. So is a page that names the artist in a tiny fraction of its paragraphs while listing many other names.
This is NOT a lesser "about". A page that merely lists the artist is worthless as a source and its other names are actively dangerous, because they read as this artist's collaborators when they are competitors on the same index.

"no" — not this artist at all. A different person or band with the same or similar name; a PRODUCT sharing the name (audio hardware, software, a film); a page that mentions them once in passing while being about something else; or a page you cannot tell either way.

Each page carries a MENTIONS line giving how many of its paragraphs name the artist. Weigh it — a very low share is strong evidence of "lists" — but it is one signal, not a rule: a short review can be entirely about the artist while naming them twice, and a long interview refers to them as "I" throughout.

Each page also carries a TIER line describing the site it came from. "low-signal" means the site generates its pages from scraped or catalogue data rather than publishing written work, so treat it as "lists" unless the page itself shows a human wrote it about this artist. "preferred" and "unknown" carry no such presumption; judge them on the page. The tier is about the SITE and never settles which person a page is about — a low-signal page about somebody else is still "no".

Reply with ONLY a JSON array, one object per numbered page, no other text:
[{"i": 0, "v": "about"}, {"i": 1, "v": "lists"}, {"i": 2, "v": "no"}]
