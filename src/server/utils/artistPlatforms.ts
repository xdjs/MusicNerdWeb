/**
 * Every platform we store an id for, and where that id lives.
 *
 * WAS ELEVEN OF THIRTY. urlmap configures thirty platforms and this listed
 * eleven, so discovery was blind to nineteen — including discogs (22,862
 * artists), wikipedia (7,606), imdb (5,201) and linktree (2,238). The visible
 * cost: an artist's own Linktree could be filed as press about them, because
 * the "is this a profile we already hold" check had never heard of linktree.
 *
 * NOT DERIVED FROM urlmap, though it is checked against it. Deriving the host
 * from the url template gives the wrong answer for the platforms that matter
 * most: bandcamp's template is `%@.bandcamp.com`, so a substituted host reads
 * `x.bandcamp.com`; spotify's resolves to `open.spotify.com`, which is
 * NARROWER than the correct `spotify.com` and would stop matching the bare
 * domain. `ens` and `wallet` carry placeholder urls. Derivation would have
 * shipped a subtler version of the bug it was meant to fix.
 *
 * So it stays explicit, and scripts/check-platform-coverage.ts fails loudly
 * when urlmap holds a platform this does not classify — drift becomes a
 * failure rather than a silence.

/**
 * The subset worth handing the relevance judge as evidence of WHO the artist is.
 *
 * Narrower than the list above on purpose, and the reason is mentionDensity:
 * it treats every identifier as a handle to look for in a page's paragraphs, so
 * an opaque value poisons the count. discogs is `1967268` and facebookID is
 * `399778650221956` — any page containing that digit string would read as
 * being about the artist. imdb is `nm8483808`, which is not a name either.
 *
 * What is in here is name-shaped, checked against real rows: wikipedia is
 * `Billie_Eilish`, bandsintown is `12895856-billie-eilish`, and the rest are
 * handles a person chose. Crypto identities (ens, mirror, zora, lens,
 * farcaster) are left out: they are wallet names rather than artist names, and
 * ".eth" appearing in a paragraph says nothing about whose page it is.
