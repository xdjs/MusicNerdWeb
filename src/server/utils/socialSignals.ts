/**
 * Pure analysis over an artist's stored social posts. No LLM, no I/O — every
 * function here takes rows in and returns signals out, so it is fully
 * unit-testable against fixtures extracted from a real scrape.
 *
 * Correctness rule (see socialIngest.ts and the design doc): a scraped feed
 * includes posts authored by OTHER people where the artist is a collaborator
 * (tagged / co-authored). `isOwnPost` is the load-bearing field — caption and
 * "in their own words" analysis (themes, standouts) is scoped to the
 * artist's OWN posts only. Collaboration is read from `coauthors` and from
 * the `ownerUsername` of posts NOT authored by the artist.
 *
 * Every returned item carries at least one source post URL (`evidenceUrls`,
 * or a single `url`) so a downstream consumer can always trace a claim back
 * to a real post.
 *
 * EVIDENCE INVARIANT (product-owner-caught defect, see the design doc and
 * `.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-17-post-claim-onboarding/signal-integrity-report.md`):
 * a signal's `evidenceUrls` (or `url`) MUST be the URL(s) of the exact
 * post(s) the signal's claim is actually about — never a different post
 * that merely shares a time window, a topic, or a rank (e.g. "top post that
 * month"). A downstream question built from a signal is only as honest as
 * this mapping. Every derive* function below enforces this structurally: it
 * only ever pushes `post.url` for the SAME post it just read the claim's
 * content from — never a URL picked by a separate ranking/sort over a
 * different set of posts. Do not add a signal that assembles its evidence
 * from anything other than the post(s) it directly read the claim from.
