 * `instagram.com/p/DUtSSjnCYcU` — a POST — comes back as
 * `{ siteName: "instagram", id: "p" }`. Anything that then writes that to the
 * artist row sets their Instagram handle to "p".
 *
 * Discovery surfaces post and status URLs constantly (they are what a search for
 * an artist's name mostly returns), so this is not a hypothetical: it is one
 * readable post page away from firing.
