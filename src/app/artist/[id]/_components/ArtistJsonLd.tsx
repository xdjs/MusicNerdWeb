/**
 * The page, said in a way a machine can read.
 *
 * The measurement that prompted this: an artist page fetched as Googlebot
 * already contains the name, the bio and every link in its initial HTML — this
 * is a server-rendered app and the worry that "bots cannot execute the
 * JavaScript so there is nothing to scrape" does not apply to it. What was
 * missing was smaller and more specific. A crawler got prose and had to infer
 * from it that this page is about a musician, that these eight URLs are the
 * same person's accounts, and which of the names in the paragraph is the
 * subject. schema.org says all three outright.
 *
 * `sameAs` is the part that matters most. It is the standard way to state "these
 * accounts are this entity", and it is what lets a search engine or an assistant
 * merge a Music Nerd page with what it already holds instead of treating it as
 * an unrelated document that happens to share a name. Namesakes are the whole
 * problem this pipeline fights; here we get to answer it in one field.
 *
 * Kept to what we can back. No aggregate ratings, no invented genres, no
 * founding dates — the same rule the vault runs on.
