/**
 * What the artist sees while their page is built.
 *
 * The flow used to be a conversation, so the surface was a chat: message
 * bubbles, a typing indicator, a four-segment step rail, and a tall empty
 * column waiting for replies. None of that is true any more — the build asks
 * nothing. Pete: "it's not a chat anymore, it's more of a loading state so it
 * should feel more like that."
 *
 * So: a compact status card. Three stages, each pending, running, or done,
 * with the finished label carrying its own count. No bubbles, no typing dots,
 * no step rail for steps that no longer exist.
 *
 * The chat surface is still used on the RESUME path, where an artist genuinely
 * is answering step cards — see OnboardingChat, which switches to this view
 * only while no step card has appeared.
