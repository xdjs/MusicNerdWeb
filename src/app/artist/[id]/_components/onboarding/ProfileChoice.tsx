/**
 * Two accounts, one platform, and only the artist knows which.
 *
 * The auto-build cannot stop to ask — nobody is watching it — so it writes the
 * best-evidenced account and sends the alternative here. That is the whole
 * reason this is a separate card rather than part of the profiles step: by the
 * time there is somebody to ask, the link is already made.
 *
 * BEFORE THIS, THE ALTERNATIVE WAS DISCARDED IN THREE PLACES — discovery's
 * dedupe kept one per platform, the client's live feed merged on platform, and
 * the profiles card hid multi-candidate platforms and reported them as "still
 * missing". Black Dave MK2 runs two real Instagram accounts and confirmed both
 * are his; we found one, silently dropped the other, and told him we had found
 * nothing.
 *
 * ONE HANDLE STILL WINS. `artists.instagram` is a single column, so this is a
 * choice, not a multi-select — the artist swaps which account is linked, and
 * the other is let go. Presenting it as anything else would promise storage
 * that does not exist.
 *
 * Writes through /api/directEditLink, the same authorized endpoint the profile
 * page's own link editor uses (`canEditArtist`), rather than a new turn type:
 * the onboarding steps are already confirmed by the time this appears, and a
 * turn would try to advance a flow that has finished.
