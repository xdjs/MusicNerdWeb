/**
 * Keeps the research queue moving while somebody is on the page.
 *
 * The scrape and the caption extraction are minutes of work, and no request
 * lives that long, so they run as jobs — and a job needs invocations to run in.
 * The artist reading the vault step is the opportunity: they spend minutes
 * there, and each tick is a full-budget invocation happening while someone is
 * actually waiting for the result.
 *
 * Deliberately its own hook rather than part of useOnboardingChat. It shares
 * nothing with the chat, and putting it there meant a background fetch racing
 * the chat's own — which the chat tests noticed immediately by having their
 * mocked response eaten.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget by design: nothing on screen depends on it, a failure is not
 * the artist's problem, and the work is claimed atomically so overlapping ticks
 * cannot double-run it.
