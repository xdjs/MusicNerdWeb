/**
 * A one-time guided pass, AFTER the page is built.

 * ceremony. But it leaves them on a finished page with no idea what happened or
 * what they're allowed to change. Pete, 2026-08-21: "a person needs to know what
 * to do after the build is done."
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a wizard in front of the work. A wizard is a gate wearing a
 * different hat: it still blocks the payoff and still explains things the artist
 * has no context for yet. Here the thing being described is already on screen and
 * already theirs, so "this is your About" means something.
 *
 * The card is ANCHORED beside the section it describes, with an arrow pointing at
 * it, the section lifted above a dimmed page. A first pass put the card at the
 * bottom of the screen; it read as a notification rather than direction, which is
 * a fair description of what it was.
 *
 * Targets element ids rather than layout, so the page can be rearranged without
 * touching this, and it still renders if a section is missing.
