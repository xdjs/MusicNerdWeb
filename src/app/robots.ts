 * robots.txt, generated so it can name every sitemap chunk.
 *
 * The static public/robots.txt pointed at /sitemap.xml, and there is no
 * /sitemap.xml any more: chunking the sitemap moves the files to
 * /sitemap/0.xml, /sitemap/1.xml and so on, and Next does not serve an index at
 * the old path. A crawler following the old pointer got a 404, which is worse
 * than the one-url sitemap it replaced.
 *
 * robots.txt takes as many Sitemap lines as we give it, so it names the chunks
 * directly and there is no index to keep in step with them. The list comes from
 * the same function that decides how many chunks exist, so the two cannot
 * disagree.
