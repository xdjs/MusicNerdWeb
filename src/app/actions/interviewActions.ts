 * WHY the interview may reopen — not just whether.

 * "published" is something the artist put out since we last spoke: a post, a
 * record. The date means something, so the questions are scoped to it and are
 * about the new thing.
 *
 * "learned" is something WE found out since: posts stored, or credits read out
 * of captions we already held. Just as real, but the posts behind it were
 * published months ago. Scoping by publication date filters every one of them
 * away — which is how an artist could be told there was nothing new minutes
 * after we finished reading 199 of his posts and pulling 187 credits out of
 * them. For "learned" the whole feed is the window; `excludeKeys` is what stops
 * repeats, not the date.
 *
 * The old version of this returned a bare boolean and its docstring said "a
 * post scraped" while the code checked `postedAt`. The comment described the
 * intent and the code did something else.
 *
 * BOTH CAN BE TRUE AT ONCE, which is why this is not an enum.
 *
 * The first version returned one of "none" | "published" | "learned" and
 * answered "published" the moment it found a newer post, without ever asking
 * about learned material. A scrape that brings in one new post AND finally
 * extracts credits from two years of older captions is the common case for a
 * returning artist — and that version kept the window scoped to `since`, so
 * `newerThan` dropped every one of the older credits. Not the full lockout the
 * rest of this fix is about, but the same loss in miniature, and no test caught
 * it because the tests exercised the two branches separately.
