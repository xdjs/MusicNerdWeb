/**
 * Every artist page, in chunks.
 *
 * There was no sitemap worth the name: `public/sitemap.xml` held ONE url, the
 * homepage, against 41,988 artist pages. Every bit of structured data on those
 * pages sat somewhere a crawler had no route to, and being the source an
 * assistant cites is unreachable from a site nothing can enumerate.
 *
 * NO BAR. Two earlier versions of this filtered — first to pages with prose
 * (262 of 41,988), then to pages with three or more verified links (30,378) —
 * on the argument that thin content at scale is a quality signal against the
 * domain. That rule is about auto-generated filler, not about database records:
 * Discogs and MusicBrainz carry millions of sparse entries and rank fine. Pete
 * settled it — "I don't think we should exclude any artist profiles" — and a
 * directory that hides most of its directory is not one.
 *
 * WHICH MAKES THE 50,000 CAP THE REAL PROBLEM. A sitemap holds fifty thousand
 * urls; there are nearly forty-two thousand artists and the number only goes
 * up. The previous version's answer was to truncate at 45,000, dropping the
 * least recently updated pages in silence — exactly the failure nobody notices
 * until an artist asks why they are not in Google.
 *
 * So this is chunked. Next serves an index at /sitemap.xml pointing at
 * /sitemap/0.xml, /sitemap/1.xml and so on, each well inside the limit, and the
 * number of chunks follows the size of the directory without anybody
 * maintaining it.
