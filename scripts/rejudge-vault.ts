/**
 * Re-runs the relevance judge over an artist's ALREADY-APPROVED vault sources.
 *
 * Discovery judges a page once, at the moment it is found. When the judge learns
 * something new, every source approved before that stays as it was — so an
 * artist can be left with a source the current judge would never have accepted.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. `lists-artist` was added after a marketplace
 * directory titled "Producers who worked with <artist>" had already been
 * approved on a real profile, and its OTHER producers' credits were being
 * written into his knowledge document as his own collaborators.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/rejudge-vault.ts <artistId|name> [--apply]
 *
 * Dry run by default: prints a verdict per source and changes nothing. --apply
 * rejects everything the judge no longer calls coverage, then rebuilds the
 * knowledge document so the change actually reaches the Ask section.
 *
 * Rejects rather than deletes — the row stays for audit, and rejection is
 * durable, so discovery will not re-offer it. DEV ONLY.
