/**
 * Does a change to the research pipeline make it better or worse?
 *
 * Until now we answered that by running one artist and reading the output. That
 * is how a regression ships: you check the artist you were thinking about and
 * miss every other shape of failure.
 *
 * This resets a fixed set of artists to the state one actually arrives in — the
 * DSP ids MusicNerd creates them with, nothing else — runs discovery, and scores
 * the result against what we know to be true. It writes a report you can diff
 * against the last one.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/research-benchmark.ts              # every case
 *   npx tsx scripts/research-benchmark.ts pete dupes   # named cases
 *   npx tsx scripts/research-benchmark.ts --no-write   # don't save a report
 *
 * DEV ONLY. It deletes and rewrites artist state, so it refuses production.
 *
 * The ground truth below is hand-verified, not generated. Every handle was
 * checked against a live page; every forbidden host is a namesake this pipeline
 * has actually fallen for.
