/**
 * Does discovery know about every platform the product does?
 *
 * The lists in vaultWebSearch.ts are hand-maintained on purpose — deriving a
 * platform's domain from urlmap's url template gives the wrong answer for the
 * ones that matter most (bandcamp's template is `%@.bandcamp.com`, so a
 * substituted host reads `x.bandcamp.com`; spotify's resolves to
 * `open.spotify.com`, narrower than the correct `spotify.com`). But hand
 * maintenance is exactly how they fell nineteen platforms behind without
 * anybody noticing.
 *
 * So this is the tripwire: it fails when urlmap holds a platform the lists do
 * not classify. Drift becomes a failure rather than a silence.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/check-platform-coverage.ts
 *
 * Not a jest test because it needs the real urlmap table, which the suite
 * mocks. Run it when platforms are added.
