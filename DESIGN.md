# MusicNerdWeb — Design System (DESIGN.md)

## Purpose & how to use this doc

This file inventories the existing visual and interaction patterns. Verify tokens and component
behavior in the current checkout before using its counts or examples. It is a baseline for
design work, not a veto on an approved redesign; later product direction is recorded in
[the decision log](docs/rnd/decisions.md).

Two rules for using it:

1. **It documents what EXISTS today**, grounded in the actual code — not an aspirational redesign. Where a value is a stock shadcn/Tailwind default that was never rebranded, this doc **flags it as stock** so it can be changed *on purpose* rather than by accident.
2. **When proposing any UI change, state it against this system.** Say which token/utility/component you are touching, whether you are following an existing convention or introducing a new one, and — if you are diverging — why. Prefer editing tokens over adding one-off hex literals.

A companion section, [Known inconsistencies to reconcile](#known-inconsistencies-to-reconcile), catalogs where the current implementation contradicts itself. Treat that table as the backlog of design-debt decisions: each row is a place where a human should pick one source of truth.

> **The single most important fact about this codebase:** the brand identity (candy-neon pink/blue/green over frosted glass) is applied *on top of* an **unmodified shadcn "slate" token layer**, almost entirely through hardcoded hex literals and a ~330-line wall of `!important` dark-mode overrides — not through the semantic token system. `--primary` is navy slate; the brand's pink lives outside the tokens as three different hex values. Nearly every inconsistency below traces back to this.

## Design philosophy

MusicNerd is a **playful, indie, candy-neon music directory dressed in Apple-style frosted glass.** The personality lives in a handful of electric accent colors — a hot orchid pink, a bright cyan, and a jelly mint-green — set against a light-forward, rounded, glassmorphic surface language, with a lowercase-casual voice ("music nerd", "Made in Seattle by @cxy @clt and friends"). Underneath, the structural chrome (buttons, cards, inputs, semantic tokens) is stock shadcn slate — brand character is layered on top as ad-hoc hex accents and glass utilities.

**Signature visual moves:**

- **The neon accent trio** — `pastyblue #2ad4fc`, `pastypink #ef95ff`, `jellygreen #19ffb8`. The whimsical names ("pasty", "jelly") are themselves a voice cue. `maroon #422b46` is the deep-aubergine "ink" for footer/body text.
- **The glowing hot-pink wordmark** — the homepage renders only a giant lowercase `music nerd` in `#ff9ce3` with a pink `textShadow` glow, fluid-sized `clamp(32px → 84px)` with tight negative letter-spacing.
- **Apple-style glassmorphism panels** — `.glass` (translucent white + `backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%)`) is the primary surface across 13+ artist-page components and admin. Even the scrollbar is themed to match.
- **Ambient, calm motion** — logo spins on hover, a pulsing "Live" ping dot, staggered 30ms feed fade-ins, framer-motion scroll parallax on the artist hero. Slow (3–20s), eased, never frantic.
- **Round everything** — circular avatars, pill indicators, `rounded-lg`/`rounded-2xl` surfaces, a pink placeholder avatar.
- **The light→dark accent swap** — dark mode deliberately shifts the accent from **pink → cyan/green** (checked checkboxes `#ff9ce3` → `#2ad4fc`; feed live dot emerald → jellygreen). The pink wordmark is the one element forced to stay pink in both modes.

**Design principles (inferred from the actual UI):**

1. **Neon accents, quiet chrome.** Deploy pastypink/pastyblue/jellygreen as punctuation on top of neutral slate surfaces — never as full backgrounds or large fills.
2. **Glass is the surface language.** Prefer `.glass` / `.glass-subtle` for panels; keep radii generous (0.75–2rem) and edges soft.
3. **Round everything.** Circular avatars, pill indicators, rounded cards/buttons; avoid hard corners.
4. **Motion should feel alive but calm.** Spinning logo, live ping, staggered fades, scroll parallax — slow, eased, ambient.
5. **Pink is the identity in light; cyan/green take over in dark.** Honor the light→dark accent swap already coded into checkboxes and the live feed.
6. **Lowercase, friendly, personal voice.** Short, casual, a little self-aware; credit real humans ("Made in Seattle by @cxy @clt and friends"); no corporate polish. Dev humor leaks through (a loading spinner's alt text is literally `alt="whyyyyy"`).
7. **Big, fluid, tightly-tracked display type.** Use `clamp()` fluid sizing with negative letter-spacing for hero headlines — the `music nerd` wordmark is the template.

**What to avoid (to stay on-brand):**

- Don't introduce a **fourth pink or a new blue.** Three pinks already exist; consolidate toward named tokens instead of inventing more hex.
- Don't make accent colors **load-bearing backgrounds** or large fills — neon-on-neon breaks the "quiet chrome" balance.
- Don't ship **opaque, hard-edged, flat cards** where a glass panel is expected.
- Don't rely on the **KoHo** class names expecting that typeface — KoHo never loads in the app; those classes render as system sans-serif.
- Don't add more **`!important` dark-mode patch overrides** — the override wall is already brittle. Prefer theming via CSS-variable tokens.
- Don't force **serious/corporate copy, ALL-CAPS shouting, or sharp geometric/brutalist styling** — it contradicts the lowercase, playful, glassy, indie personality.

## Color

MusicNerdWeb's color system is **three disconnected layers that never reconcile**: a 4-color brand palette in `tailwind.config.ts`, a stock untouched shadcn "slate" semantic-token layer in `globals.css`, and a dead SCSS file (`_colors.scss`) that redefines the brand under different names and is imported nowhere. The visual identity is applied almost entirely through hardcoded hex literals (200+ occurrences) and `!important` dark-mode overrides — **not** through tokens. The brand pink alone exists as **three different hex values**.

### 1. Brand palette — `tailwind.config.ts` (lines 26–29)

Plain Tailwind color extensions. **Not** wired into the semantic `--primary`/`--accent` tokens.

| Token (Tailwind class) | Value | Direct uses in `src/` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `maroon` | `#422b46` | 1 | Footer text (`.text-maroon`), forced white in dark mode |
| `pastyblue` | `#2ad4fc` | 1 | Also hardcoded for dark checkbox + moon icon |
| `pastypink` | `#ef95ff` | 93 | Most-used brand token; also the hero gradient pink |
| `jellygreen` | `#19ffb8` | (via raw hex) | Appears mainly as raw hex in ActivityFeed |

### 2. Semantic HSL tokens — `globals.css` `:root` / `.dark` (lines 35–90)

**These are verbatim stock shadcn/ui "slate" defaults** (navy `222.2 47.4% 11.2%` primary, `210 40% 96.1%` secondary, `0 84.2% 60.2%` destructive). **None carry the brand's pink/blue/green** — the semantic layer was scaffolded from shadcn and never rebranded. Consumed as `hsl(var(--token))` via `tailwind.config.ts` (lines 30–62).

| Token | Light (`:root`) | Dark (`.dark`) |
|---|---|---|
| `--background` | `0 0% 100%` | `222.2 84% 4.9%` |
| `--foreground` | `222.2 84% 4.9%` | `210 40% 98%` |
| `--card` | `0 0% 100%` | `222.2 84% 4.9%` |
| `--card-foreground` | `222.2 84% 4.9%` | `210 40% 98%` |
| `--popover` | `0 0% 100%` | `222.2 84% 4.9%` |
| `--popover-foreground` | `222.2 84% 4.9%` | `210 40% 98%` |
| `--primary` | `222.2 47.4% 11.2%` | `210 40% 98%` |
| `--primary-foreground` | `210 40% 98%` | `222.2 47.4% 11.2%` |
| `--secondary` | `210 40% 96.1%` | `217.2 32.6% 17.5%` |
| `--secondary-foreground` | `222.2 47.4% 11.2%` | `210 40% 98%` |
| `--muted` | `210 40% 96.1%` | `217.2 32.6% 17.5%` |
| `--muted-foreground` | `215.4 16.3% 46.9%` | `215 20.2% 65.1%` |
| `--accent` | `210 40% 96.1%` | `217.2 32.6% 17.5%` |
| `--accent-foreground` | `222.2 47.4% 11.2%` | `210 40% 98%` |
| `--destructive` | `0 84.2% 60.2%` | `0 62.8% 30.6%` |
| `--destructive-foreground` | `210 40% 98%` | `210 40% 98%` |
| `--border` | `214.3 31.8% 91.4%` | `217.2 32.6% 17.5%` |
| `--input` | `214.3 31.8% 91.4%` | `217.2 32.6% 17.5%` |
| `--ring` | `222.2 84% 4.9%` | `212.7 26.8% 83.9%` |
| `--radius` | `0.5rem` | (same) |

**Chart colors** (`--chart-1..5`) are **also stock shadcn defaults**:

| | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| `--chart-1` | `12 76% 61%` | `220 70% 50%` |
| `--chart-2` | `173 58% 39%` | `160 60% 45%` |
| `--chart-3` | `197 37% 24%` | `30 80% 55%` |
| `--chart-4` | `43 74% 66%` | `280 65% 60%` |
| `--chart-5` | `27 87% 67%` | `340 75% 55%` |

**Custom token** — `--subtitle-color` (line 61 / 89):

| | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| `--subtitle-color` | `rgb(89, 48, 97, 0.6)` | `rgb(198, 191, 199)` |

Note: the light value uses the malformed legacy 4-arg `rgb(r,g,b,a)` syntax (should be `rgba()`); the dark value drops alpha entirely.

### 3. SCSS layer — `src/app/_colors.scss` (DEAD / unimported)

`grep` confirms this file is **imported nowhere**. It redefines the brand under a *second* naming scheme and defines `.text-color-primary { color: $primary }` (`#2ad4fc`), which collides by name with a live definition in `globals.css`.

| SCSS var | Value | Duplicates |
|---|---|---|
| `$primary` | `#2ad4fc` | `pastyblue` |
| `$secondary` | `#ef95ff` | `pastypink` |
| `$tertiary` | `#19ffb8` | `jellygreen` |
| `$grey` | `rgb(184, 182, 182)` | — |
| `$purple` | `rgb(25, 0, 50)` | — |
| `$lightpurple` | `rgb(100, 0, 200)` | — |

### 4. The "real" brand pink is fragmented into 3 hex values

The pink actually seen on screen (splash title, highlighted leaderboard rows, checked checkboxes in light mode, focus rings) is **`#ff9ce3`** — 57 occurrences — **defined nowhere in the palette**, and different from `pastypink` `#ef95ff`. A third pink `#EDADF8` powers `.text-color-primary` and `.pink-btn`.

| Pink | Where | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `#ef95ff` | `pastypink` / `$secondary` / HeroSection gradient | `tailwind.config.ts:28`, `_colors.scss:2` |
| `#ff9ce3` | "Music Nerd" title, highlight borders/glows, light checked checkbox, focus rings, ActivityFeed `--feed-artist` | 57 hardcoded uses; `globals.css:168–277`, `485–488` |
| `#EDADF8` | `.text-color-primary`, `.pink-btn` background | `globals.css:516`, `585` |

### Gradients

| Gradient | Definition | File |
|---|---|---|
| Hero brand wash | `bg-gradient-to-br from-[#ef95ff]/20 via-transparent to-[#7c3aed]/15` | `artist/[id]/_components/HeroSection.tsx:79` |
| Hero dark overlay | `bg-gradient-to-b from-black/20 to-black/50` | `HeroSection.tsx:82` |
| Press thumb fallback | `bg-gradient-to-br from-pastypink/10 via-purple-900/20 to-transparent` | `PressAndFeatures.tsx:68` |

Note the hero uses raw hex (`#7c3aed` violet-600, `#ef95ff`) while the press thumb uses the `pastypink` token + Tailwind `purple-900` — two vocabularies for the same "pink→purple" wash.

### Glass / glassmorphism — `globals.css`

The "Apple-style glass" look is built from **white-alpha layers, not tokens**:

| Utility | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| `.glass` | `bg rgba(255,255,255,0.55)`; `blur(20px) saturate(180%)`; border `1px rgba(255,255,255,0.3)`; radius `1rem` | `bg rgba(30,30,30,0.55)`; border `1px rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` |
| `.glass-subtle` | `bg rgba(255,255,255,0.35)`; `blur(12px) saturate(150%)`; border `1px rgba(255,255,255,0.25)`; radius `0.75rem` | `bg rgba(40,40,40,0.4)`; border `1px rgba(255,255,255,0.06)` |
| `.scrollbar-glass` | thumb `rgba(255,255,255,0.18)`, hover `0.32`, track transparent, 6px | (same) |

### Ad-hoc palettes hidden in overrides (not tokenized)

- **Dead duplicate `:root` block (create-next-app leftover)** — `globals.css:519–528` defines a *second* `:root` with `--foreground-rgb: 0,0,0`, `--background-start-rgb: 214,219,220`, `--background-end-rgb: 255,255,255`, plus a bare `body { color: rgb(var(--foreground-rgb)); background: white }` and `.dark body { background: #1a1a1a }`. This hardcoded body background **overrides** the token-driven `@apply bg-background text-foreground` set earlier — an unmentioned dead/duplicate token layer and a direct token-vs-hardcode inconsistency.
- **Dark-mode neutral ramp** — Tailwind slate values hardcoded as hex rather than driven by `--background`/`--muted` (lines 112–532): `#1a1a1a` (dark body), `#2d3748` (panels/search), `#4a5568` (hover/border), `#f7fafc` (near-white text), `#a0aec0` (muted text), `#374151` (borders).
- **Leaderboard / UGC "mauve" family** — a purple-grey micro-palette used only through `!important` overrides (lines 132–304): `#9b83a0`, `#c6bfc7`, `#6f4b75`, `#b8b1b9`, `#a08ba8`, `rgb(89,48,97,0.6)`, `rgb(198,191,199)`, `rgb(111,75,117,0.8)`. `rgb(89,48,97,0.6)` is the same value as light `--subtitle-color` but re-typed as a literal everywhere.
- **ActivityFeed** (`ActivityFeed.tsx:69–115`) defines its **own parallel token system** via injected `--feed-*` custom properties with light/dark variants — reusing brand hex (`#ff9ce3`, `#19ffb8`, `#2ad4fc`) plus one-offs `#5a4d5e`, `#3d2f42`, `#9b8a9f`, `#059669` (emerald), `#0891b2` (cyan-600), `#c44a8c`, `#e0d8e2`. This is the best-structured light/dark token set in the app and is a good candidate for promotion into the shared layer.

### Interactive accents

- **Checkbox checked:** light `#ff9ce3`, dark `#2ad4fc`; checkmark forced `white`.
- **Theme-toggle moon icon (dark):** `#2ad4fc`.
- **Notification dot:** `bg-red-600` with a forced 2px white border in dark. (The 6 `#FF0000` hits in the tree are test-fixture `colorHex` mock values in `src/__tests__/components/ArtistLinks.test.tsx`, not UI colors — there are zero `#ff0000` literals in shipping app code.)
- **Highlight glow:** `box-shadow 0 0 20px rgba(255,156,227,0.3)` (`#ff9ce3` at 0.3), forced via `!important`.

### Theme mechanism

Dark mode is **class-based** (`darkMode: 'class'`) driven by a **custom `ThemeProvider`** (`_components/ThemeProvider.tsx`) — **not `next-themes`**, despite next-themes being the documented convention. It toggles `.light`/`.dark` on `<html>`, persists to `localStorage` key `musicnerd-theme`, and falls back to `prefers-color-scheme`. Because most of dark mode is expressed as `!important` overrides of hardcoded light values rather than swapped token values, the `.dark` block runs ~330 lines.

---

## Typography

### The headline finding: the brand typeface never loads in the app

The intended brand font is **KoHo** (Google font), but **it is not loaded anywhere in the Next.js app.** There is no `next/font` import in `src/`, no `<link>` font tag in `layout.tsx`, no `@font-face`/`@import` in `globals.css`, no font package in `package.json`, and no `fontFamily` key in `tailwind.config.ts`.

`globals.css` *declares* `font-family: "KoHo", sans-serif` in three places — `.koho-extralight` (weight 200), `.koho-light` (weight 300), and `.pink-btn` — but because KoHo never loads, **each silently falls back to `sans-serif`**. `.pink-btn` is a shipping class (the "Log In" button), so the login button renders in system sans-serif, not KoHo.

**Net effect:** the entire app renders in Tailwind's default `font-sans` stack (`ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, …`). No `font-family` is set on `body`. Stock Tailwind behavior, no customization — an unintended gap between design intent (KoHo) and reality (system font). **Assume the app font is the default sans stack.**

KoHo *does* load correctly, but only in two standalone static files outside the React app — `public/tmprivacy.html` and `public/mnidprivacy.html` (Google Fonts `<link>`, weights 200–700, their own inline `koho` Tailwind family). The declared brand stack is therefore **`"KoHo", sans-serif`** with weights **200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700** — but it only manifests on the legal pages.

### Type scale — stock Tailwind defaults, no custom scale

There is **no custom `fontSize` scale**; every `text-*` resolves to Tailwind built-ins. Actual usage across `src/`:

| Tailwind class | Size / line-height | Uses | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text-xs` | 12px / 16px | 108 | Badges, captions, metadata, timestamps |
| `text-sm` | 14px / 20px | 138 | **De-facto body/UI size** — table body, card descriptions, buttons |
| `text-base` | 16px / 24px | 22 | `Input` default |
| `text-lg` | 18px / 28px | 40 | Sub-headings |
| `text-xl` | 20px / 28px | 22 | Section headings |
| `text-2xl` | 24px / 32px | 14 | `CardTitle`, artist name |
| `text-3xl` | 30px / 36px | 5 | Page H1s ("Admin Dashboard", "User Profile") |
| `text-4xl` | 36px / 40px | 1 | `.artist-name` utility only (`globals.css:696`, `text-4xl text-purple-500`) |

No `text-5xl`+ anywhere. Root size is browser default 16px (never overridden).

### Weights

Four Tailwind weight utilities appear; the app maps to a narrow band:

| Class | Uses | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `font-semibold` (600) | 62 | Dominant emphasis/heading weight (card titles, badges, table headers) |
| `font-medium` (500) | 41 | Buttons (`text-sm font-medium`), labels |
| `font-bold` (700) | 33 | Page H1s (`text-3xl font-bold`) |
| `font-normal` (400) | 8 | Occasional body reset |

The two light weights the brand cares about — **200 (`.koho-extralight`) and 300 (`.koho-light`)** — are defined but never render (KoHo isn't loaded; the classes aren't applied by any component).

### Letter-spacing & line-height

Sparse, mostly on the shadcn `CardTitle` and a few headings: `leading-none` ×11, `leading-tight` ×9, `leading-relaxed` ×6, `leading-snug` ×2; `tracking-tight` ×3, `tracking-wide` ×2, `tracking-wider` ×1, `tracking-widest` ×1. Canonical pattern (stock shadcn): `CardTitle = text-2xl font-semibold leading-none tracking-tight`.

### The real display type — two hand-rolled fluid clamp headings

The only genuinely designed (non-default) type on the site is two fluid headings, both interpolated across a **360px → 1440px** viewport window:

1. **Homepage "music nerd" title** — `HomePageSplash.tsx`, inline-styled (the largest type on the site):
   - `font-size: clamp(32px, calc(32px + (84 - 32) * ((100vw - 360px) / (1440 - 360))), 84px)`
   - `letter-spacing: clamp(-1px, …, -4px)` (tightens as it grows), `line-height: 1`, `lowercase font-bold`
   - color `#ff9ce3` with `textShadow: 0 0 40px rgba(255,156,227,0.25)` — a **pink glow, not a gradient.**
2. **`.home-text-h2`** — `globals.css:616`: `font-size: clamp(28px, …, 70px)`, `letter-spacing: clamp(-1px, …, -3px)`, `line-height: clamp(36px, …, 70px)`; colored `#9b83a0` (light) / `#a08ba8` (dark) as subtitle, or `#ff9ce3` as a title variant. **Legacy/dead** — referenced only inside `globals.css`, never applied by any `.tsx`.

### Special text treatments

- **Pink glow, not gradient text.** There is **no gradient-clipped text** anywhere (`bg-clip-text` / `text-transparent` = 0 hits). All `bg-gradient-*` usages are background gradients on `<div>` overlays, not type. The only text effect is the `#ff9ce3` glow on the homepage title, defended aggressively against dark-mode overrides via ~15 `!important` selectors (`globals.css:168–277`).
- **Animated-text components exist but are unused (dead code):** `TypeWriter.tsx` (char-by-char, `startDelay=1000ms`, `typingDelay=80ms`) and `SlidingText.tsx` (vertical word-carousel, `interval=1000ms`, the only consumer of `.home-text-height`). **Neither is imported anywhere.**
- **Marquee/spin keyframes** available to text/logo rows: `scroll-left`/`scroll-right` (`20s linear infinite`) and `slow-spin` (`10s`) — all currently unused.
- **`.pink-btn`** (login button): declared KoHo (falls back to sans-serif), `18px` desktop / `16px` <768px, `color #422B46` on `#EDADF8`, `border-radius: 5px`.

---

## Layout & spacing

MusicNerdWeb has **no shared page-container primitive**. The root layout is a flex column; each page defines its own centered column with an ad-hoc `max-w-* mx-auto` and its own padding. Tailwind's stock `container` config is present but **dead** — the `.container` class appears nowhere in `src/`. Breakpoints and the radius scale are unmodified defaults; the only bespoke layout logic is fluid `clamp()` typography and one hand-written SCSS media query.

### Root shell (`src/app/layout.tsx`)

```
<body className="min-h-screen flex flex-col">
  <Nav />
  <main className="flex-grow flex flex-col min-h-0 w-full"> {children} </main>
  <Toaster />
  <Footer />   // mt-auto pins footer to bottom
```

A sticky-footer flex column. `<main>` imposes **no** max-width or padding — every page owns its own gutters.

### Page container rules (the real convention)

The dominant pattern is a **centered column** (`max-w-* mx-auto`) with padding that steps up at `sm:`, and vertical section stacking via `space-y-6`.

| Page | Container className | Max width | H-pad | V-pad |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nav (`NavContent.tsx:11`) | `w-full px-3 py-3 sm:p-6 … max-w-[1000px] mx-auto` | `1000px` | `px-3 → sm:6` | `py-3 → sm:6` |
| Home (`HomePageSplash.tsx:7`) | `px-6 sm:px-8 pt-0 pb-4 … w-full` + inner `max-w-2xl` | `2xl` (42rem) | `px-6 → sm:8` | `pt-0 pb-4` |
| Artist (`artist/[id]/page.tsx:107`) | `w-full max-w-[800px] mx-auto px-4 py-5 space-y-6` | `800px` | `px-4` | `py-5` |
| Admin (`admin/page.tsx:50`) | `admin-page px-4 sm:px-10 py-5 space-y-6` | none (full-bleed) | `px-4 → sm:10` | `py-5` |
| Leaderboard/Profile (`leaderboard/ClientWrapper.tsx`) | `px-5 sm:px-10 py-10` | none | `px-5 → sm:10` | `py-10` |
| Add-artist (`AddArtistContent.tsx`) | `min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center` + card `p-8 max-w-2xl w-full mx-4` | `2xl` | `mx-4` / card `p-8` | centered |
| Footer (`Footer.tsx:3`) | `px-5 py-5 w-full text-center mt-auto` | none | `px-5` | `py-5` |

Horizontal gutters cluster on **`px-4`/`px-5` → `sm:px-8`/`sm:px-10`**; vertical page padding is **`py-5`** (content pages) or **`py-10`** (leaderboard). Named max-widths are inconsistent — `800px` (artist), `2xl` (home, add-artist), `1000px` (nav) — with no shared token. The dead container config would have capped at **1400px**.

### Section / card shell (artist page)

The repeated content-section shell is a glass panel: **`glass p-4 sm:p-5 space-y-3`** (used 5× on the artist page). Page sections are separated by the parent's `space-y-6`; content inside each panel stacks on `space-y-3`.

The shadcn `Card` primitive is **stock**: `rounded-lg border bg-card shadow-sm`, with `CardHeader`/`Content`/`Footer` all on **`p-6`**. The codebase mostly uses the custom `.glass p-4/p-5` panels rather than `Card` for primary layout — so **two padding conventions coexist** for card-like surfaces.

### Breakpoints

**No custom breakpoints** — `theme.screens` is never set, so all defaults apply.

| Token | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| sm | 640px | Tailwind default |
| md | 768px | Tailwind default |
| lg | 1024px | Tailwind default |
| xl | 1280px | Tailwind default |
| 2xl | 1536px | Tailwind default |
| container `2xl` | **1400px** | `tailwind.config.ts:20` (overrides container max only; **unused**) |

Effective usage is a near-two-breakpoint system: `sm:` **157×**, `md:` **41×**, `lg:` **7×**, `xl:`/`2xl:` **0×**. One hand-written SCSS breakpoint at **`max-width: 768px`** (`globals.css:631`) governs `.nav-bar`, `.nav-grid`, `.home-text`, `.pink-btn` — duplicating Tailwind's `md` boundary in raw CSS. Fluid title sizing uses `clamp()` over **360px → 1440px**, independent of the breakpoint tokens.

### Spacing & gutter conventions

Drawn from Tailwind's 4px scale, with clear favorites:

- **Flex/grid gap:** `gap-2` (0.5rem) dominant (**65×**), then `gap-4` (27×), `gap-1` (21×), `gap-3` (17×), `gap-1.5` (12×). `gap-2` is the default inline-cluster gutter.
- **Vertical stacking:** `space-y-4` dominant (**24×**), `space-y-2` (17×), `space-y-3` (14×); page-level sections use `space-y-6`.
- **Component padding (stock shadcn):** Button `default h-10 px-4 py-2`, `sm h-9 px-3`, `lg h-12 px-8`, `icon h-10 w-10`; Input/SelectTrigger `h-10 px-3 py-2`; Badge `px-2.5 py-0.5`; `Dialog p-6`.
- **Custom off-scale utility:** `.pink-btn` uses `5px` vertical / `30px` horizontal padding (`4px` on mobile).

### Border-radius scale

Base token **`--radius: 0.5rem` (8px)**, not overridden in `.dark`. Tailwind derivations use the stock shadcn formula:

| Class | Formula | Computed |
|---|---|---|
| `rounded-lg` | `var(--radius)` | 8px |
| `rounded-md` | `calc(var(--radius) - 2px)` | 6px |
| `rounded-sm` | `calc(var(--radius) - 4px)` | 4px |
| `rounded-xl` | Tailwind default | 12px |
| `rounded-2xl` | Tailwind default | 16px |
| `rounded-full` | 9999px | pill |

Usage: `rounded-full` **65×** (icons, avatars, badges, genre pills), `rounded-md` **53×** (buttons, inputs, selects), `rounded-lg` **28×**, `rounded` **14×**, `rounded-sm` **9×**, `rounded-xl` **7×**. **Off-scale hardcoded radii** live in `globals.css` and do not derive from `--radius`: `.glass` = **16px**, `.glass-subtle` = **12px**, `.search-bar` & `.pink-btn` = **5px**, glass scrollbar thumb = `9999px`.

## Components

The UI is built on a **shadcn/ui + Radix** primitive layer in `src/components/ui/` (21 files), wrapped and extended by custom feature components in `src/app/_components/`. Most primitives are **stock shadcn defaults** (unmodified generated code); a handful were hand-edited, and **those edits are the load-bearing design facts.** Only **four** primitives use `cva` for variants — Button, Badge, Toast, Label — everything else is a fixed-className Radix wrapper.

> **Record for future contributors:** brand identity is carried by the **custom components + global utilities**, not the primitives. Style at the custom-component layer; don't fork primitives.

### Core primitives — variants & sizes (`cva`)

| Component | File | Variants | Sizes | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Button** | `button.tsx` | `default`, `destructive`, `outline`, `secondary`, `ghost`, `link` | `default` (h-10 px-4 py-2), `sm` (h-9 px-3), `lg` (h-12 px-8), `icon` (h-10 w-10) | `default`/`default` | `rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors`, focus-visible ring-2. **Deviation:** the `default` variant is only `bg-primary text-primary-foreground` — stock `hover:bg-primary/90` was removed, so the primary button has **no hover feedback** |
| **Badge** | `badge.tsx` | `default`, `secondary`, `destructive`, `outline` | — | `default` | `rounded-full border px-2.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-semibold`. Stock |
| **Toast** | `toast.tsx` | `default`, `destructive` | — | `default` | `rounded-md border p-6 pr-8 shadow-lg`, swipe anims. Stock (Radix Toast) |
| **Label** | `label.tsx` | none (cva with base string only) | — | — | `text-sm font-medium leading-none`. Stock |

### Non-cva primitives (fixed styling, Radix-wrapped or plain)

| Component | File | Notable styling | Stock or modified |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Card** (+ Header/Title/Description/Content/Footer) | `card.tsx` | `rounded-lg border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow-sm`; header `p-6 space-y-1.5`; title `text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight`; content `p-6 pt-0` | Stock |
| **Input** | `input.tsx` | `flex w-full rounded-md bg-background px-3 py-2 text-base … placeholder:text-muted-foreground disabled:opacity-50` | **Heavily stripped:** no `h-10`, **no `border border-input`**, **no `focus-visible:ring`**, uses `text-base` (stock uses `text-sm`). Renders borderless & height-less — forms must re-style via `className` |
| **Textarea** | `textarea.tsx` | `min-h-[50px] w-full rounded-md border border-input bg-background text-base md:text-sm` | Modified: `min-h-[50px]` (stock 80px), and **`focus-visible:ring-2` is missing** (has `ring-ring`/`ring-offset-2` but no ring width) so the focus ring won't render |
| **Select** (Radix) | `select.tsx` | `SelectTrigger h-10 border border-input focus:ring-2`; popper slide/zoom anims | Stock |
| **Tabs** (Radix) | `tabs.tsx` | `TabsList h-10 rounded-md bg-muted`; `TabsTrigger data-[state=active]:bg-background data-[state=active]:shadow-sm` | Stock |
| **Dialog** (Radix) | `dialog.tsx` | `DialogContent max-w-lg gap-4 border bg-background p-6 shadow-lg sm:rounded-lg`, overlay `bg-black/80` | **Modified:** className prefixed with `dark:bg-gray-900 text-foreground` (hardcoded dark surface instead of `bg-background`) |
| **Table** (+ Header/Body/Footer/Row/Head/Cell/Caption) | `table.tsx` | `TableRow hover:bg-muted/50`; `TableHead h-10 px-2 text-muted-foreground` | **Modified:** `TableCell` adds `whitespace-nowrap overflow-hidden text-ellipsis` (truncating cells); padding `px-2`/`p-2` (stock `p-4`) |
| **Tooltip** (Radix) | `tooltip.tsx` | `rounded-md border bg-popover px-3 py-1.5 text-sm shadow-md`, `sideOffset=4` | Stock |
| **Checkbox** (Radix) | `checkbox.tsx` | `h-4 w-4 rounded-sm border border-primary data-[state=checked]:bg-primary` | Stock |
| **DropdownMenu** (Radix, full set) | `dropdown-menu.tsx` | `bg-popover p-1 rounded-md shadow-md`, `inset` prop, Check/Circle/ChevronRight icons | Stock |

Additional stock primitives present but not individually styled: `aspect-ratio`, `calendar`, `carousel`, `drawer`, `form`, `popover`, `toaster`.

### Signature custom components (`src/app/_components/`)

- **HomePageSplash** — homepage hero. Lowercase `music nerd` `<h1>` with fluid `clamp()` font-size (32px → 84px), negative letter-spacing, **hardcoded** `color: #ff9ce3` + pink `textShadow` glow, then mounts `ActivityFeed`. Uses raw hex, not the `pastypink` token.
- **ArtistLinks** — async server component. Platform links as **list rows** (`StaticPlatformLink` / `EditablePlatformLink` when `canEdit`) using `.link-item-grid` + `.corners-rounded` globals; splits monetized "support" links from general links, injects Spotify/Deezer.
- **ArtistLinksGrid** — the newer **grid-based** link renderer that coexists with `ArtistLinks`. Circular glassmorphism tiles: `w-12 h-12 rounded-full backdrop-blur-sm bg-white/70 dark:bg-white/10 border-white/40`, with `group-hover:scale-110` and a colored glow (pink `shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(239,149,255,0.45)]`, blue for Deezer/listen).
- **EditableLinkIcon** — editable glass tile; adds a red `-top-1 -right-1` delete `X` gated on `EditModeContext.isEditing`, posting to `/api/directEditLink`.
- **ThemeToggle** — a **fully custom animated pill switch** (not Radix Switch). Mobile `w-12 h-12` circle and desktop `w-28 h-8` pill with sliding knob + "Dark Mode"/"Light Mode" labels; Moon/Sun icons. Colors hardcoded inline (`#2d3748`/`#f3f4f6` track, `#2ad4fc` moon = `pastyblue` value).
- **EditModeToggle** — wraps shadcn `<Button variant="outline" size="sm">`, restyled with brand `pastypink` (`border-pastypink/50 text-pastypink hover:bg-pastypink hover:text-white`); Pencil/Check icons.
- **BookmarkButton** — wraps shadcn `<Button variant="outline" size="sm">`, `localStorage`-backed toggle, fixed `w-[120px]`, `pastypink` fill/border states.
- **SlidingText** — vertical text carousel cycling `ReactNode[]` via `translateY`. Uses `.home-text-height`. **Dead code (imported nowhere).**
- **TypeWriter** — char-by-char typewriter (`startDelay=1000ms`, `typingDelay=80ms`). **Dead code (imported nowhere).**
- **LoginBtn** (`buttons/LoginBtn/index.tsx`) — **legacy pre-shadcn button**: raw `<button className="pink-btn">` (`background #EDADF8`, maroon `#422B46` text, KoHo font, `5px` radius, 18px). Evidence of an older button system still in the tree.
- **nav/** — top nav: spinning logo (`hover:animate-[spin_3s_linear_infinite]`), `SearchBar`, `AddArtist`, `Login`. `Login.tsx` branches to `NoWalletLogin` (admin gear) or `PrivyLogin` (email-first auth); also `LegacyAccountModal`.

### Design facts to record

- The shadcn primitives are **~70% stock generated code.** Meaningful hand-edits: Button (removed default hover), Input (stripped border/height/ring), Textarea (`min-h-[50px]`, missing ring width), Dialog (`dark:bg-gray-900`), Table (truncating cells, tighter padding).
- **Three parallel button systems** coexist: the cva `Button`, the legacy `.pink-btn` global class, and the fully-custom `ThemeToggle` `<button>`.
- **Two artist-link renderers** coexist: `ArtistLinks` (list rows) and `ArtistLinksGrid` (glass icon grid).
- Brand color is applied **two ways**: via Tailwind tokens (`pastypink`, `pastyblue`) in `EditModeToggle`/`BookmarkButton`, and via hardcoded hex (`#ff9ce3`, `#2d3748`, `#EDADF8`) in `HomePageSplash`, `ThemeToggle`, `.pink-btn`.
- **A dead pre-shadcn utility-class layer survives** in `globals.css:679–738`: `@apply`-based legacy classes `.navbar`, `.logo`, `.login-button` (`bg-purple-600`), `.support-button`/`.sound-button`/`.world-button` (`bg-green-500`), `.play-button` (`bg-pink-500`), `.support-input`, `.scroll-text`, and a duplicate `.search-bar { @apply p-2 border rounded }` that conflicts with the earlier `.search-bar { border-radius: 5px }`. Evidence of an older styling system predating shadcn, still in the tree.

## Motion & interaction

The motion system is a **three-layer stack**: (1) `tailwindcss-animate` powering stock shadcn/Radix enter/exit transitions, (2) hand-written CSS `@keyframes` in `globals.css`, and (3) `framer-motion` (v12.36.0) used in exactly three artist-page components for scroll-driven and scroll-reveal effects. The signature gesture is a **pink-glow lift** on hover (scale + colored box-shadow). There is **no `prefers-reduced-motion` handling anywhere**, and several defined animations are dead code.

### Animation tokens

| Name | Duration | Easing | Definition | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fadeSlideIn` | `0.3s` | `ease-out both` | opacity `0→1`, `translateY(-8px→0)` | **Live** — `ActivityFeed.tsx:230` |
| `accordion-down` | `0.2s` | `ease-out` | height `0 → var(--radix-accordion-content-height)` | **Dead** — no Accordion exists |
| `accordion-up` | `0.2s` | `ease-out` | height `var(...) → 0` | **Dead** — no Accordion exists |
| `scroll-left` | `20s` | `linear infinite` | `translateX(0 → -50%)` (marquee) | **Dead** — zero usages |
| `scroll-right` | `20s` | `linear infinite` | `translateX(0 → 50%)` | **Dead** — zero usages |
| `slow-spin` | `10s` | `linear infinite` | `rotate(0 → 360deg)` | **Dead** — zero usages |

`tailwindcss-animate` supplies the `animate-in`/`animate-out`/`fade-in-0`/`zoom-in-95`/`slide-in-from-*` utilities used by the shadcn primitives — **stock strings, unmodified.** Dialog content overrides the default to `duration-200`; everything else inherits the tailwindcss-animate default (~150ms).

**Tailwind utility durations actually used (`.tsx`):** `duration-300` ×22 (de-facto standard), `duration-200` ×3, `duration-500` ×2, `duration-150` ×1, `duration-1000` ×1. **Only easing utility used:** `ease-in-out` ×6. There is **no tokenized duration/easing scale** — 300ms is convention by repetition, not definition.

**Framer-motion transitions** (inline per-component, not tokenized):

- `RevealSection.tsx` — `transition={{ duration: 0.5, ease: "easeOut", delay }}`, `initial={{opacity:0, y:30}} → whileInView={{opacity:1, y:0}}`, `viewport={{ once: true, margin: "-50px" }}`.
- `HeroSection.tsx` — scroll-linked via `useScroll` + `useTransform`: parallax `bgY 0%→50%`, `bgOpacity 1→0`, `photoScale 1→0.65`, `photoOpacity 1→0`, `stickyOpacity 0→1`.

### Interaction principles (as observed)

- **Hover — the signature "pink-glow lift."** `transition-all duration-300` + `group-hover:scale-110` + a colored glow box-shadow, on circular link icons (`ArtistLinksGrid.tsx`, `EditableLinkIcon.tsx`): `group-hover:scale-110 group-hover:shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(239,149,255,0.45)] group-hover:bg-white/90`. Cards echo it larger — `PressAndFeatures.tsx:65` `hover:shadow-[0_0_30px_rgba(239,149,255,0.35)]`; hero photo `hover:shadow-[0_0_25px_rgba(239,149,255,0.5)]`. The "listen"-platform variant swaps the glow to **blue** `rgba(0,199,242,0.45)`. ActivityFeed rows use a subtler `hover:bg-[var(--feed-hover-bg)]` + `group-hover:h-5` accent-bar growth.
- **Hover — shadcn primitives.** Stock `transition-colors` tint-shifts (`hover:bg-secondary/80`, `hover:bg-accent`). **Deviation:** the `default` button variant has **no hover state** (stock ships `hover:bg-primary/90`).
- **Focus.** Stock focus rings on button, tabs, checkbox (`focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2`) and badge/dialog-close/toast (`focus:ring-2`). **Deviation:** `input.tsx` has **no border and no `focus-visible` ring** — text inputs have no default focus affordance.
- **Active/press.** No `active:` classes anywhere — there is **no press-scale or tactile down-state feedback.**
- **Theme toggle** is the most deliberately animated control: pill + sliding knob use `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out`; labels cross-fade via `transition-opacity duration-300`.
- **Loading/ambient.** `animate-spin` bordered rings (AgentWorkSection, ArtistDataSection, UserEntriesTable, UserSearch), `Loader2` (VaultManager); `animate-pulse` on the login placeholder and the "Ask" logo; `animate-ping` on the "Live" dot (`ActivityFeed.tsx:202`).
- **Scrollbars.** `.scrollbar-glass` — bespoke 6px thin scrollbar, `rgba(255,255,255,0.18)` thumb → `0.32` on `:hover` (the only scrollbar hover transition, instantaneous). `.scrollbar-hide` fully hides.

### Signature motion

1. **Fade-slide-in feed (live).** The only bespoke keyframe wired up. `ActivityFeed` applies `animate-fadeSlideIn` with **staggered `animationDelay: i*30ms`** on first load and a **depth opacity decay** (`Math.max(0.45, 1 - i*0.035)`), plus the `animate-ping` "Live" pulse.
2. **Scroll-driven hero (framer-motion).** `HeroSection` + `StickyHeroBar` layer a parallax: blurred bg drifts at half-speed and fades, the centered photo scales `1→0.65` and fades, a frosted sticky bar fades in — all pure `MotionValue`s ("no React state" per the code comment), so it's jank-free.
3. **Reveal-on-scroll (framer-motion).** `RevealSection` — reusable `whileInView` fade-up (`opacity 0→1`, `y 30→0`, `0.5s easeOut`, fires `once`).
4. **Orphaned signature motion (dead code).** `TypeWriter.tsx` and `SlidingText.tsx` are fully built but imported nowhere. `SlidingText.tsx:33` also uses `transition-max-height` — **not a valid Tailwind utility**, so the intended collapse/expand is un-animated (latent bug, dormant).

## Known inconsistencies to reconcile

Each row is a design-debt decision: pick one source of truth and migrate. Ordered roughly by blast radius.

| # | What diverges | Where | Suggested single source of truth |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Brand pink = 3 values.** `#ef95ff` (pastypink token / `$secondary` / hero gradient), `#ff9ce3` (wordmark + highlights + light checkbox + focus rings, 57 hardcoded uses, in no palette), `#EDADF8` (`.pink-btn` / `.text-color-primary`). | `tailwind.config.ts:28`, `globals.css:485/516/585`, `HomePageSplash.tsx:16` | One canonical `brand.pink` token in `tailwind.config.ts`; migrate the 57 `#ff9ce3` literals and `#EDADF8`. The palette pink (`#ef95ff`) isn't even the pink users see. |
| 2 | **Brand palette never reaches the semantic layer.** `--primary`/`--secondary`/`--accent`/`--ring`/`--chart-*` are 100% stock shadcn slate in both `:root` and `.dark`; brand is applied only as one-off hex on top. | `globals.css:34–91`, `tailwind.config.ts:26–29` | Decide on purpose: either keep the semantic layer intentionally neutral, or map `--primary`/`--accent`/`--ring` onto the brand palette so components inherit brand color. |
| 3 | **"Primary" means two opposite colors.** SCSS `$primary` = cyan `#2ad4fc`; shadcn `--primary` = navy slate `222.2 47.4% 11.2%`. Code reading "primary" gets different intent per system. | `_colors.scss:1`, `globals.css:42` | Rename SCSS `$primary/$secondary/$tertiary` → `$brand-*`, or feed the brand palette into the shadcn tokens so the two agree. |
| 4 | **`_colors.scss` is dead code.** Imported nowhere; duplicates the brand under a second naming scheme; its `.text-color-primary` (`$primary` = `#2ad4fc`) conflicts with the live `globals.css:516` definition (`#EDADF8`). | `_colors.scss` | Delete it, or wire it in and remove the shadowing. Do not keep a second brand naming scheme. |
| 5 | **Dark mode = ~330 lines of `!important` overrides**, not token swaps. Neutral ramp hardcoded as slate hex (`#1a1a1a`, `#2d3748`, `#4a5568`, `#f7fafc`, `#a0aec0`) bypassing `--background`/`--card`/`--muted`. | `globals.css:102–532` | Migrate to token swaps in the `.dark` block so new components inherit dark styling. Long-term this is the highest-leverage cleanup. |
| 6 | **`--subtitle-color` re-typed as a literal.** `rgb(89,48,97,0.6)` is both the light token and a raw literal in ~8 leaderboard/FunFacts overrides. Also the token uses malformed 4-arg `rgb()` (light) and drops alpha (dark). | `globals.css:61/89/138/281–303` | Reference the token instead of re-typing; fix `rgb(...)` → `rgba(...)`. |
| 7 | **KoHo never loads in the app.** No `next/font`, `<link>`, `@font-face`, or font package. `.koho-*` and `.pink-btn` fall back to system sans; KoHo only loads in `public/*privacy.html`. | `layout.tsx`, `globals.css:572/578/587`, `package.json` | Decide if KoHo is the brand font. If yes, load once via `next/font/google` in `layout.tsx` and set as Tailwind `font-sans`. If no, delete the dead `.koho-*` classes. |
| 8 | **Three parallel button systems.** cva `Button`, legacy `.pink-btn` (`LoginBtn`), hand-rolled `ThemeToggle` `<button>`. | `button.tsx`, `globals.css:584`, `ThemeToggle.tsx` | Standardize on shadcn `Button`; retire `.pink-btn`/`LoginBtn`. Keep `ThemeToggle` bespoke (documented exception). |
| 9 | **Default Button has no hover state.** Stock `hover:bg-primary/90` was removed; every other variant has a hover. | `button.tsx:12` | Restore `hover:bg-primary/90` (or document the removal as intentional). |
| 10 | **Input primitive stripped bare.** No border, no fixed height, no focus-visible ring; `text-base` instead of `text-sm`. Every form must re-add chrome. Inconsistent with fully-styled Textarea/Select. | `input.tsx:13` | Restore stock border/`h-10`/focus ring, or document Input as intentionally bare. |
| 11 | **Textarea focus ring won't render.** Has `ring-ring` + `ring-offset-2` but is missing `focus-visible:ring-2` (no ring width). | `textarea.tsx:12` | Add `focus-visible:ring-2` to match Select/Button (accessibility). |
| 12 | **Dialog hardcodes `dark:bg-gray-900`** instead of `bg-background`/`bg-card`, diverging from token-driven theming. | `dialog.tsx:41` | Use the surface token. |
| 13 | **Two artist-link renderers.** `ArtistLinks` (list rows) vs `ArtistLinksGrid` (glass icon grid) — different visual languages for the same data. | `ArtistLinks.tsx`, `ArtistLinksGrid.tsx` | Pick one canonical renderer; retire or clearly scope the other. |
| 14 | **No shared page-container primitive.** Max-widths diverge with no token: `800px` (artist), `2xl` (home/add-artist), `1000px` (nav). | per-page wrappers | Extract a `<PageContainer>` (e.g. `max-w-[800px] mx-auto px-4 sm:px-8 py-5`); reconcile the max-widths. |
| 15 | **Dead container config.** `tailwind.config.ts` defines center/padding-2rem/2xl-1400px, but `.container` is used nowhere; real content width is 800–1000px. | `tailwind.config.ts:20` | Adopt the container class, or delete the config. |
| 16 | **Inconsistent horizontal gutters.** `px-3` (nav), `px-4` (artist/admin), `px-5` (leaderboard/footer), `px-6` (home), stepping to `sm:px-8`/`sm:px-10`/`sm:p-6`. | multiple pages | Pick one step (e.g. `px-4 → sm:px-8`) and apply uniformly. |
| 17 | **768px breakpoint expressed twice.** Raw SCSS `@media (max-width:768px)` in `globals.css` **and** Tailwind `md:` utilities. | `globals.css:631` | Fold the SCSS rules into `md:` utilities, or document why nav needs hand-written CSS. |
| 18 | **Off-scale radii.** `.glass` 16px, `.glass-subtle` 12px, `.search-bar`/`.pink-btn` 5px — none derive from `--radius` (4/6/8px). | `globals.css:28/546/560/569/588` | Bring onto the `--radius` scale, or record as intentional brand exceptions. |
| 19 | **Two card padding conventions.** Custom `.glass p-4/p-5` (primary panels) vs shadcn `Card p-6`. | `globals.css`, `card.tsx` | Pick one primary panel and align padding. |
| 20 | **No motion token scale.** `duration-300` (22×) is de-facto standard, but SlidingText 500/1000ms, ThemeToggle 300ms, shadcn 150/200ms, framer 0.5s — all ad hoc. | codebase-wide | Define `--motion-fast 150ms` / `--motion-base 300ms` / `--motion-slow 500ms` + a standard easing; reference them. |
| 21 | **No `prefers-reduced-motion` guard.** Infinite spins, `animate-ping`, scroll parallax, staggered feed all run unconditionally. | codebase-wide | Add a global strategy; use framer's `useReducedMotion` for scroll effects. |
| 22 | **Two pink-glow hexes.** Hover glows use `rgba(239,149,255,x)` (`#ef95ff`); title shadow + highlight box-shadow use `rgba(255,156,227,x)` (`#ff9ce3`). | `ArtistLinksGrid.tsx`, `HomePageSplash.tsx`, `globals.css:414` | One `brand-glow` token. |
| 23 | **Two vocabularies for the pink→purple gradient.** HeroSection raw hex `from-[#ef95ff] to-[#7c3aed]`; PressAndFeatures tokens `from-pastypink via-purple-900`. | `HeroSection.tsx:79`, `PressAndFeatures.tsx:68` | One expression (prefer tokens). |
| 24 | **Dead typography.** `.home-text-h2`, `.home-text-height`, ~15 `!important` `#ff9ce3` overrides, `SlidingText.tsx`, `TypeWriter.tsx` — all legacy/unapplied. | `globals.css`, `_components/` | Delete, or wire back in. If keeping SlidingText, fix the invalid `transition-max-height`. |
| 25 | **Dead animation code.** `accordion-down`/`up` (no Accordion), `.animate-scroll-left`/`-right`, `.animate-slow-spin` — zero usages. | `tailwind.config.ts`, `globals.css` | Delete or wire up. |
| 26 | **Two fluid-heading definitions.** HomePageSplash h1 (32–84px inline) vs `.home-text-h2` (28–70px CSS) both re-implement the 360–1440px clamp by hand. | `HomePageSplash.tsx:13`, `globals.css:617` | Extract the clamp into a shared utility/token. |
| 27 | **No custom type scale or font tokens.** Every `text-*` is a stock Tailwind default; no single source of truth for the type system. | codebase-wide | Document a minimal named scale (which `text-*` + weight = H1/H2/body/caption). |
| 28 | **Cyan under two names.** `pastyblue` (Tailwind) and `$primary` (SCSS) both = `#2ad4fc`; pink has token + untracked literals. | `tailwind.config.ts`, `_colors.scss` | Consolidate naming across the two color systems. |
| 29 | **Theme uses custom `ThemeProvider`, not `next-themes`** (the documented convention). | `_components/ThemeProvider.tsx` | Document this so contributors don't assume next-themes APIs. |
| 30 | **ActivityFeed `--feed-*` is a parallel token system** — a well-structured light/dark set duplicating brand hex the rest of the app hardcodes. | `ActivityFeed.tsx:69–115` | Consider promoting into the shared token layer. |

## Proposing design changes

This system evolves by editing tokens, not by scattering more literals. When you propose a change:

1. **Change the token first, in the right place.** Color lives in three places today — keep them in sync deliberately:
   - **Brand palette** → `tailwind.config.ts` `theme.extend.colors` (`pastypink`/`pastyblue`/`jellygreen`/`maroon`).
   - **Semantic tokens** → `globals.css` `:root` / `.dark` (`--background`, `--primary`, `--radius`, etc.). Remember these are still stock slate — rebranding them is a deliberate, high-leverage act, not a casual edit.
   - **SCSS** (`_colors.scss`) is currently **dead** — don't add to it unless you're intentionally reviving it.
   Radius → `--radius`. Motion → introduce the `--motion-*` scale (see #20) rather than another `duration-*` literal.

2. **State the change against this doc.** Name the token/utility/component you're touching, whether you're following a convention (e.g. `.glass p-4 sm:p-5` panels, `gap-2` clusters, the pink-glow-lift hover) or introducing a new one, and — if diverging — why.

3. **Don't add a new hex, pink, blue, breakpoint, or button system.** Three pinks, two cyan names, three button systems, and two link renderers already exist. Migrate toward the named tokens; consolidate rather than extend. If you must add a one-off, add a row to [Known inconsistencies](#known-inconsistencies-to-reconcile) so it's tracked, not lost.

4. **Prefer token swaps over `!important` dark overrides.** The `.dark` override wall is the most brittle part of the system. New components should inherit dark styling from tokens; adding another `!important` patch is a regression, not a fix.

5. **Style at the custom-component layer, not the primitives.** Brand identity lives in `src/app/_components/` and the global utilities. The shadcn primitives are mostly stock — fork them only to fix a documented deviation (Input focus ring, default Button hover), not to inject brand color.

6. **Honor the personality.** Neon accents on quiet chrome; glass surfaces; round everything; calm ambient motion; lowercase friendly voice; pink identity in light, cyan/green in dark. When in doubt, the `music nerd` wordmark and the `.glass` panel are the templates.
