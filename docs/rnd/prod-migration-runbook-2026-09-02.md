# Production migration runbook — 2026-09-02

> Dated release runbook for migrations 0011–0023. These are not fresh-clone setup steps or a request to replay production SQL. Verify the current target and migration history using the development protocol. See the [documentation map](../README.md).

Run these against **production** Supabase (`cbabvmebugudeuylronz`) in the SQL
editor, in order, before deploying code that depends on them. Migrations
0011–0021 were required before #1195; 0022–0023 are required before #1200.
Merging first starts application paths against tables or columns that do not
exist yet.

Each block is wrapped in `BEGIN` / `COMMIT`. Postgres DDL is transactional, so a failure rolls the whole step back rather than leaving the schema half-applied. Run one block, run its check, then move on.

## Before you start

Do **not** treat any whole step below as safe to re-run. Some individual table
and index statements use `IF NOT EXISTS`, but several migrations also contain
unguarded constraints or `CREATE POLICY` statements that fail when the object
already exists. Run this first:

```sql
SELECT
  t.name,
  CASE WHEN to_regclass('public.' || t.name) IS NULL THEN 'absent — will be created' ELSE 'ALREADY EXISTS — stop' END AS status
FROM (VALUES
  ('artist_docs'), ('artist_interview_answers'), ('artist_onboarding_steps'),
  ('artist_social_posts'), ('artist_social_profiles'),
  ('artist_doc_corrections'), ('artist_social_credits'), ('artist_research_jobs')
) AS t(name);
```

For a database starting at 0011, all eight should read `absent`. If 0011–0021
were already applied, all eight should exist—but table presence alone is not
proof that the column- and index-only migrations landed. Before skipping to
0022, run the **Check** query after every 0011–0021 section except 0017 and
confirm every result is true. The 0019 migration deliberately replaces and
drops all 0017 indexes, so a database through 0021 must pass the 0019 check,
not the superseded 0017 check. This includes the columns from 0013 and 0015,
the current indexes from 0019 and 0020, and the explicit absence checks for
the retired 0017 indexes. Any false result or mixed table result means a
partial migration: stop and reconcile it instead of rerunning a whole block.

-- The indexes from 0017 stopped matching the query they were built for.

-- legacy "@handle" form and comparing that against a normalized candidate
-- reported a claimed handle as free. Postgres cannot serve the new expression
-- from the old index, so every ownership check went back to scanning all
-- ~42,000 artists — and the propagation path runs it dozens of times inside a
-- 45-second budget.
--
-- Indexes on the exact expression the query uses. The 0017 indexes are dropped

```sql
BEGIN;

-- One caption can credit the same person with more than one role.
--
-- 0018's uniqueness key was (artist_id, kind, source_url, md5(quote), subject),
-- which treats "Mixing & Mastering Engineer: @x" and "Mixed by @x" as the same
-- row when both were read from the same sentence. onConflictDoNothing then
-- silently discarded every role after the first, so the stored extraction and
-- the document lost valid credits without any error.

## 0021_artist_research_jobs.sql

Creates: `artist_research_jobs` (table), `artist_research_jobs_one_live` (index), `artist_research_jobs_claimable` (index)

```sql
BEGIN;

-- Long research work, outside the request that asked for it.
--
-- The Instagram scrape takes one to five minutes and caption extraction takes
-- seventy seconds for a small feed and several minutes for a large one. Both
-- were run from an onboarding turn via after(), which is bounded by the route's
-- 60s maxDuration — so on the primary flow the platform killed the invocation
-- partway and the credits never arrived. The document was then written from an
-- empty credits table, and nothing rebuilt it. Every artist except the ones we
-- pre-warmed by hand got a profile with none of this work in it.
--
-- A row here is a unit of work that survives the request that created it.
-- Progress lives on the row, so a slice that runs out of time leaves a cursor
-- rather than losing everything, and any later invocation continues from it.
--
-- WHY status AND cursor RATHER THAN "are there any rows yet".
-- The old completion check was "does this artist have any credit rows", which
-- cannot tell a half-finished extraction from a finished one, and reports an
-- artist whose captions genuinely contain nothing as never having run. Silence
-- meaning "we did not manage it" being read as "there is nothing there" is the
-- single most repeated bug in this subsystem. Status makes it impossible.

## 0022_interview_sitting.sql

Adds: `artist_interview_answers.sitting`

The app connects as `mnweb`, while the SQL editor runs with the privileged role
needed for DDL. Existing table-level grants and RLS policies cover new columns;
the check below verifies both assumptions explicitly.

```sql
BEGIN;

ALTER TABLE artist_interview_answers
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sitting integer;

UPDATE artist_interview_answers
SET sitting = 1
WHERE sitting IS NULL;

COMMIT;
```

Check:

   FROM information_schema.columns

## 0023_interview_offer_watermark.sql

     AND table_name = 'artist_interview_answers'
     AND column_name = 'offered_at') AS column_exists,

```

Expected: `1 | 0 | true | true | true | true`.


## After all thirteen

```sql
SELECT * FROM (VALUES
  ('table', 'artist_docs', to_regclass('public.artist_docs') IS NOT NULL),
  ('table', 'artist_interview_answers', to_regclass('public.artist_interview_answers') IS NOT NULL),
  ('table', 'artist_onboarding_steps', to_regclass('public.artist_onboarding_steps') IS NOT NULL),
  ('table', 'artist_social_posts', to_regclass('public.artist_social_posts') IS NOT NULL),
  ('table', 'artist_social_profiles', to_regclass('public.artist_social_profiles') IS NOT NULL),
  ('table', 'artist_doc_corrections', to_regclass('public.artist_doc_corrections') IS NOT NULL),
  ('table', 'artist_social_credits', to_regclass('public.artist_social_credits') IS NOT NULL),
  ('table', 'artist_research_jobs', to_regclass('public.artist_research_jobs') IS NOT NULL),
  ('column', 'artist_interview_answers.sitting', EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'artist_interview_answers' AND column_name = 'sitting'
  )),
  ('column', 'artist_interview_answers.offered_at', EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'artist_interview_answers' AND column_name = 'offered_at'
  ))
) AS t(kind, name, present);
```

Every per-step artifact check must pass. This final summary should show ten rows,
all `true`, and both column checks above must return
`1 | 0 | true | true | true | true`. Then #1200's database prerequisite is
satisfied.

## One caveat

These are being applied by hand rather than through `drizzle-kit migrate`, so
nothing writes to Drizzle's migration journal. That matches how dev was done
and how the July RLS fix went in, but it means a future `db:migrate` against
production would try to re-apply them. Do not use `db:migrate` to catch this
database up until its journal has been reconciled: multiple steps are
non-idempotent, including the unguarded `CREATE POLICY` statements in 0018 and
0021, and migration would stop at the first existing object before
later work could run.
